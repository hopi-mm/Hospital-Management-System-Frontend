# Hospital-Management-System-Frontend
## Getting Started (with Bun)

Better to use bun instead of npm and yarn 

If you don't have bun, here's to install bun

```bash
curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
```
After install, restart the terminal so bun is available.

## Project Setup

```bash
git clone git@github.com:lerover/hospital-management-system.git

```

```bash
cd hospital-management-system
```

```bash
bun install
```

```bash
bun run dev
```
